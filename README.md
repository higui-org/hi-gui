# HI-GUI

Hi! First release under development.


Description:
HiGUI, a groundbreaking GUI library that simplifies interface design for both non-coders and developers. Users will customize interfaces through a high-level config file, bypassing coding complexities. 

Developers benefit from:
- User-friendly C++ GUI developing, 
- Advanced animation support,
- GLSL shader integration. 

HiGUI features:
- Image display from URLs, 
- GUI builder, 
- 3D.

hiGUI objects mimic HTML pages with CSS styling, offering vast creative and design possibilities. 
My goal is to blend simplicity with advanced functionality in UI design.
